To run the program, please go to the folder where you have extracted the files through the terminal with the "cd" command.
Type in "make" ("make clean" if it is not the first time you are running it).
Type in "./fruittetris"

To play, press "Up arrow" to rotate, "A" and "D" to change the angle of the lower arm, "W" and "S" to change the angle of the upper arm, press "space" to place a tile on the board, press "R" to restart.

Placing tiles seems to be buggy; it only paints two of the 6 faces of each cubic section.

It is currently missing the tile collision.
